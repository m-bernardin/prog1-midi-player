part iii:
41. a list of the notes currently recorded and how long should play for, you could play any tune that doesnt use multiple notes at once
43. yes
45. 
    internal:
    addNoteToTrack
    
    external:
    tune.getNotes
    tune.getInstrument
    sequence.createTrack
    track.add
    note.getDuration
i also messed around a little in this part and created a class which creates and plays a preset tune (i put jingle bells in there as a test)
i also started on a method which would allow chords to be played, but i dont have the brain to understand multithreading right now
